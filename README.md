<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project contains scripts simplifying common tasks such as viewing all DynamoDB tables across AWS Regions or seeing date formats available through CONVERT(). These scripts could be cli scripts, T-SQL scripts, etc. Individual folders may contain README files as well with additional information.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

- cli scripts have been tested in GitBash. Scripts are not necessarily POSIX compliant.
- T-SQL scripts are run in SSMS, 2016 or greater. Some of the table usage may be a bit older.

```
