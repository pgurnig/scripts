<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project contains scripts simplifying common tasks such as viewing all DynamoDB tables across AWS Regions or seeing date formats available using CONVERT() in T-SQL. These scripts could be cli scripts, T-SQL scripts, etc. Individual folders may contain README files as well with additional information.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

- cli scripts have been tested in GitBash. Scripts are not necessarily POSIX compliant.
- T-SQL scripts are run in SSMS, 2016 or greater. Some of the table usage may be a bit older.

```
